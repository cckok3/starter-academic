I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at Monash University. My research interests include Economic History, Political Economy, and Development Economics. Before doing a Ph.D., I was a research assistant under the division of Strategy at INSEAD, Singapore. 

I use historical data to understand the economics and politics of Southeast Asia. My current research explores the impact of a large-scale colonial resettlement programme in a Southeast Asian country.
