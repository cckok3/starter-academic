I am currently a PhD Student at Monash University. My research interests include Economic History, Political Economy, and Applied Microeconomics.

I'm passionate about using historical data to understand the economics and politics of Southeast Asia. My current research explores the impact of a large-scale colonial resettlement programme in a Southeast Asian country.
